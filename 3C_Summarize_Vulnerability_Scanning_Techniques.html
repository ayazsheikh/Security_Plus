                <h4>SECURITY ASSESSMENTS</h4>
                <p>Network reconnaissance and discovery is used to identify hosts, network topology, and open services/ports, establishing an overall attack surface. Various types of security assessments can be used to test these hosts and services for vulnerabilities. There are many models and frameworks for conducting security assessments. A good starting point is NIST's Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment (nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf). SP 800-115 identifies three principal activities within an assessment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Testing the object under assessment to discover vulnerabilities or to prove the effectiveness of security controls.</li>
                    <li>Examining assessment objects to understand the security system and identify any logical weaknesses. This might highlight a lack of security controls or a common misconfiguration.</li>
                    <li>Interviewing personnel to gather information and probe attitudes toward and understanding of security.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The main types of security assessment are usually classed as vulnerability assessment, threat hunting, and penetration testing. A vulnerability assessment is an evaluation of a system's security and ability to meet compliance requirements based on the configuration state of the system. Essentially, the vulnerability assessment determines if the current configuration matches the ideal configuration (the baseline). Vulnerability assessments might involve manual inspection of security controls, but are more often accomplished through automated vulnerability scanners.</p>

                <h4>VULNERABILITY SCAN TYPES</h4>
                <p>An automated scanner must be configured with signatures and scripts that can correlate known software and configuration vulnerabilities with data gathered from each host. Consequently, there are several types of vulnerability scanners optimized for different tasks.</p>
                <h4>Network Vulnerability Scanner</h4>
                <p>A network vulnerability scanner, such as Tenable Nessus (tenable.com/products/nessus) or OpenVAS (openvas.org), is designed to test network hosts, including client PCs, mobile devices, servers, routers, and switches. It examines an organization's on-premises systems, applications, and devices and compares the scan results to configuration templates plus lists of known vulnerabilities. Typical results from a vulnerability assessment will identify missing patches, deviations from baseline configuration templates, and other related vulnerabilities. </p>
                <p>The first phase of scanning might be to run a detection scan to discover hosts on a particular IP subnet. In the next phase of scanning, a target range of hosts is probed to detect running services, patch level, security configuration and policies, network shares, unused accounts, weak passwords, antivirus configuration, and so on.</p>
                <p>Each scanner is configured with a database of known software and configuration vulnerabilities. The tool compiles a report about each vulnerability in its database that was found to be present on each host. Each identified vulnerability is categorized and assigned an impact warning. Most tools also suggest remediation techniques. This information is highly sensitive, so use of these tools and the distribution of the reports produced should be restricted to authorized hosts and user accounts.</p>
                <p>Network vulnerability scanners are configured with information about known vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses for typical network hosts. These scanners will be able to test common operating systems, desktop applications, and some server applications. This is useful for general purpose scanning, but some types of applications might need more rigorous analysis.</p>
                <h4>Application and Web Application Scanners</h4>
                <p>A dedicated application scanner is configured with more detailed and specific scripts to test for known attacks, as well as scanning for missing patches and weak configurations. The best known class of application scanners are web application scanners. Tools such as Nikto (cirt.net/Nikto2) look for known web exploits, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), and may also analyze source code and database security to detect unsecure programming practices. Other types of application scanners would be optimized for a particular class of software, such as a database server.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>COMMON VULNERABILITIES AND EXPOSURES</h4>
                <p>An automated scanner needs to be kept up to date with information about known vulnerabilities. This information is often described as a vulnerability feed, though the Nessus tool refers to these feeds as plug-ins, and OpenVAS refers to them as network vulnerability tests (NVTs). Often, the vulnerability feed forms an important part of scan vendors' commercial models, as the latest updates require a valid subscription to acquire.</p>
                <p>Vulnerability feeds make use of common identifiers to facilitate sharing of intelligence data across different platforms. Many vulnerability scanners use the Secure Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) to obtain feed or plug-in updates (scap.nist.gov). As well as providing a mechanism for distributing the feed, SCAP defines ways to compare the actual configuration of a system to a target-secure baseline plus various systems of common identifiers. These identifiers supply a standard means for different products to refer to a vulnerability or platform consistently.</p>
                <p>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a dictionary of vulnerabilities in published operating systems and applications software (cve.mitre.org). There are several elements that make up a vulnerability's entry in the CVE:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An identifier in the format: CVE-YYYY-####, where YYYY is the year the vulnerability was discovered, and #### is at least four digits that indicate the order in which the vulnerability was discovered.</li>
                    <li>A brief description of the vulnerability.</li>
                    <li>A reference list of URLs that supply more information on the vulnerability.</li>
                    <li>The date the vulnerability entry was created.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The CVE dictionary provides the principal input for NIST's National Vulnerability Database (nvd.nist.gov). The NVD supplements the CVE descriptions with additional analysis, a criticality metric, calculated using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), plus fix information.</p>
                <p>CVSS is maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (first.org/cvss). CVSS metrics generate a score from 0 to 10 based on characteristics of the vulnerability, such as whether it can be triggered remotely or needs local access, whether user intervention is required, and so on. The scores are banded into descriptions too:</p>
