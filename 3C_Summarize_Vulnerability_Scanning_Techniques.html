        <h4>SECURITY ASSESSMENTS</h4>
        <p>
          Network reconnaissance and discovery is used to identify hosts,
          network topology, and open services/ports, establishing an overall
          attack surface. Various types of security assessments can be used to
          test these hosts and services for vulnerabilities. There are many
          models and frameworks for conducting security assessments. A good
          starting point is NIST's Technical Guide to Information Security
          Testing and Assessment
          (nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf).
          SP 800-115 identifies three principal activities within an assessment:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Testing the object under assessment to discover vulnerabilities or
            to prove the effectiveness of security controls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Examining assessment objects to understand the security system and
            identify any logical weaknesses. This might highlight a lack of
            security controls or a common misconfiguration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interviewing personnel to gather information and probe attitudes
            toward and understanding of security.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The main types of security assessment are usually classed as
          vulnerability assessment, threat hunting, and penetration testing. A
          vulnerability assessment is an evaluation of a system's security and
          ability to meet compliance requirements based on the configuration
          state of the system. Essentially, the vulnerability assessment
          determines if the current configuration matches the ideal
          configuration (the baseline). Vulnerability assessments might involve
          manual inspection of security controls, but are more often
          accomplished through automated vulnerability scanners.
        </p>

        <h4>VULNERABILITY SCAN TYPES</h4>
        <p>
          An automated scanner must be configured with signatures and scripts
          that can correlate known software and configuration vulnerabilities
          with data gathered from each host. Consequently, there are several
          types of vulnerability scanners optimized for different tasks.
        </p>
        <h4>Network Vulnerability Scanner</h4>
        <p>
          A network vulnerability scanner, such as Tenable Nessus
          (tenable.com/products/nessus) or OpenVAS (openvas.org), is designed to
          test network hosts, including client PCs, mobile devices, servers,
          routers, and switches. It examines an organization's on-premises
          systems, applications, and devices and compares the scan results to
          configuration templates plus lists of known vulnerabilities. Typical
          results from a vulnerability assessment will identify missing patches,
          deviations from baseline configuration templates, and other related
          vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first phase of scanning might be to run a detection scan to
          discover hosts on a particular IP subnet. In the next phase of
          scanning, a target range of hosts is probed to detect running
          services, patch level, security configuration and policies, network
          shares, unused accounts, weak passwords, antivirus configuration, and
          so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each scanner is configured with a database of known software and
          configuration vulnerabilities. The tool compiles a report about each
          vulnerability in its database that was found to be present on each
          host. Each identified vulnerability is categorized and assigned an
          impact warning. Most tools also suggest remediation techniques. This
          information is highly sensitive, so use of these tools and the
          distribution of the reports produced should be restricted to
          authorized hosts and user accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Network vulnerability scanners are configured with information about
          known vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses for typical network
          hosts. These scanners will be able to test common operating systems,
          desktop applications, and some server applications. This is useful for
          general purpose scanning, but some types of applications might need
          more rigorous analysis.
        </p>
        <h4>Application and Web Application Scanners</h4>
        <p>
          A dedicated application scanner is configured with more detailed and
          specific scripts to test for known attacks, as well as scanning for
          missing patches and weak configurations. The best known class of
          application scanners are web application scanners. Tools such as Nikto
          (cirt.net/Nikto2) look for known web exploits, such as SQL injection
          and cross-site scripting (XSS), and may also analyze source code and
          database security to detect unsecure programming practices. Other
          types of application scanners would be optimized for a particular
          class of software, such as a database server.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>COMMON VULNERABILITIES AND EXPOSURES</h4>
        <p>
          An automated scanner needs to be kept up to date with information
          about known vulnerabilities. This information is often described as a
          vulnerability feed, though the Nessus tool refers to these feeds as
          plug-ins, and OpenVAS refers to them as network vulnerability tests
          (NVTs). Often, the vulnerability feed forms an important part of scan
          vendors' commercial models, as the latest updates require a valid
          subscription to acquire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vulnerability feeds make use of common identifiers to facilitate
          sharing of intelligence data across different platforms. Many
          vulnerability scanners use the Secure Content Automation Protocol
          (SCAP) to obtain feed or plug-in updates (scap.nist.gov). As well as
          providing a mechanism for distributing the feed, SCAP defines ways to
          compare the actual configuration of a system to a target-secure
          baseline plus various systems of common identifiers. These identifiers
          supply a standard means for different products to refer to a
          vulnerability or platform consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a dictionary of
          vulnerabilities in published operating systems and applications
          software (cve.mitre.org). There are several elements that make up a
          vulnerability's entry in the CVE:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An identifier in the format: CVE-YYYY-####, where YYYY is the year
            the vulnerability was discovered, and #### is at least four digits
            that indicate the order in which the vulnerability was discovered.
          </li>
          <li>A brief description of the vulnerability.</li>
          <li>
            A reference list of URLs that supply more information on the
            vulnerability.
          </li>
          <li>The date the vulnerability entry was created.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The CVE dictionary provides the principal input for NIST's National
          Vulnerability Database (nvd.nist.gov). The NVD supplements the CVE
          descriptions with additional analysis, a criticality metric,
          calculated using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), plus
          fix information.
        </p>
        <p>
          CVSS is maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security
          Teams (first.org/cvss). CVSS metrics generate a score from 0 to 10
          based on characteristics of the vulnerability, such as whether it can
          be triggered remotely or needs local access, whether user intervention
          is required, and so on. The scores are banded into descriptions too:

      <section>
        <h4>INTRUSIVE VERSUS NON-INTRUSIVE SCANNING</h4>
        <p>
          A network vulnerability scanner can be implemented purely as software
          or as a security appliance, connected to the network. Some scanners
          work remotely by contacting the target host over the network. Other
          scanner types use agents installed locally on each host to perform the
          scanning and transmit a report to a management server. For example,
          Nessus Professional allows remote scanning of hosts while Nessus
          Manager, and Tenable Cloud can work with locally installed agent
          software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scan intrusiveness is a measure of how much the scanner interacts with
          the target. Non-intrusive (or passive) scanning means analyzing
          indirect evidence, such as the types of traffic generated by a device.
          A passive scanner, the Zeek Network Security Monitor (zeek.org) being
          one example, analyzes a network capture and tries to identify policy
          deviations or CVE matches. This type of scanning has the least impact
          on the network and on hosts, but is less likely to identify
          vulnerabilities comprehensively. Passive scanning might be used by a
          threat actor to scan a network stealthily. You might use passive
          scanning as a technique where active scanning poses a serious risk to
          system stability, such as scanning print devices, VoIP handsets, or
          embedded systems networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Active scanning means probing the device's configuration using some
          sort of network connection with the target. Active scanning consumes
          more network bandwidth and runs the risk of crashing the target of the
          scan or causing some other sort of outage. Agent-based scanning is
          also an active technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most intrusive type of vulnerability scanner does not stop at
          detecting a vulnerability. Exploitation frameworks contain default
          scripts to try to use a vulnerability to run code or otherwise gain
          access to the system. This type of highly intrusive testing is more
          typical of penetration testing than automated vulnerability scanning.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>CREDENTIALED VERSUS NON-CREDENTIALED SCANNING</h4>
        <p>
          A non-credentialed scan is one that proceeds by directing test packets
          at a host without being able to log on to the OS or application. The
          view obtained is the one that the host exposes to an unprivileged user
          on the network. The test routines may be able to include things such
          as using default passwords for service accounts and device management
          interfaces, but they are not given privileged access. While you may
          discover more weaknesses with a credentialed scan, you sometimes will
          want to narrow your focus to think like an attacker who doesn't have
          specific high-level permissions or total administrative access.
          Non-credentialed scanning is often the most appropriate technique for
          external assessment of the network perimeter or when performing web
          application scanning.
        </p>
        <p>
          A credentialed scan is given a user account with logon rights to
          various hosts, plus whatever other permissions are appropriate for the
          testing routines. This sort of test allows much more in-depth
          analysis, especially in detecting when applications or security
          settings may be misconfigured. It also shows what an insider attack,
          or one where the attacker has compromised a user account, may be able
          to achieve. A credentialed scan is a more intrusive type of scan than
          non-credentialed scanning.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary>Note</summary>
          <p>
            Create dedicated network accounts for use by the vulnerability
            scanner only. Ensure that the credentials for these accounts are
            stored securely on the scan server.
          </p>
        </details>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>FALSE POSITIVES, FALSE NEGATIVES, AND LOG REVIEW></h4>
        <p>
          A scanning tool will generate a summary report of all vulnerabilities
          discovered during the scan directly after execution completes. These
          reports color-code vulnerabilities in terms of their criticality, with
          red typically denoting a weakness that requires immediate attention.
          You can usually view vulnerabilities by scope (most critical across
          all hosts) or by host. The report should include or link to specific
          details about each vulnerability and how hosts can be remediated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intrusive/active scanning is more likely to detect a wider range of
          vulnerabilities in host systems and can reduce false positives. A
          false positive is something that is identified by a scanner or other
          assessment tool as being a vulnerability, when in fact it is not. For
          example, assume that a vulnerability scan identifies an open port on
          the firewall. Because a certain brand of malware has been known to use
          this port, the tool labels this as a security risk, and recommends
          that you close the port. However, the port is not open on your system.
          Researching the issue costs time and effort, and if excessive false
          positives are thrown by a vulnerability scan, it is easy to disregard
          the scans entirely, which could lead to larger problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should also be alert to the possibility of false negatives—that
          is, potential vulnerabilities that are not identified in a scan. This
          risk can be mitigated somewhat by running repeat scans periodically
          and by using scanners from more than one vendor. Also, because
          automated scan plug-ins depend on pre-compiled scripts, they do not
          reproduce the success that a skilled and determined hacker might be
          capable of and can therefore create a false sense of security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reviewing related system and network logs can enhance the
          vulnerability report validation process. As an example, assume that
          your vulnerability scanner identified a running process on a Windows
          machine. According to the scanner, the application that creates this
          process is known to be unstable, causing the operating system to lock
          up and crash other processes and services. When you search the
          computer's event logs, you notice several entries over the past couple
          of weeks indicate the process has failed. Additional entries show that
          a few other processes fail right after. In this instance, you've used
          a relevant data source to help confirm that the vulnerability alert
          is, in fact, valid.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>CONFIGURATION REVIEW</h4>
        <p>
          As well as matching known software exploits to the versions of
          software found running on a network, a vulnerability scan assesses the
          configuration of security controls and application settings and
          permissions compared to established benchmarks. It might try to
          identify whether there is a lack of controls that might be considered
          necessary or whether there is any misconfiguration of the system that
          would make the controls less effective or ineffective, such as
          antivirus software not being updated, or management passwords left
          configured to the default. Generally speaking, this sort of testing
          requires a credentialed scan. It also requires specific information
          about best practices in configuring the particular application or
          security control. These are provided by listing the controls and
          appropriate configuration settings in a template.
        </p>
        <p>
          Security content automation protocol (SCAP) allows compatible scanners
          to determine whether a computer meets a configuration baseline. SCAP
          uses several components to accomplish this function, but some of the
          most important are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)—an XML schema for
            describing system security state and querying vulnerability reports
            and information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)—an XML
            schema for developing and auditing best-practice configuration
            checklists and rules. Previously, best-practice guides might have
            been written in prose for system administrators to apply manually.
            XCCDF provides a machine-readable format that can be applied and
            validated using compatible software.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some scanners measure systems and configuration settings against best
          practice frameworks. This is referred to as a compliance scan. This
          might be necessary for regulatory compliance or you might voluntarily
          want to conform to externally agreed standards of best practice.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>THREAT HUNTING</h4>
        <p>
          Where vulnerability scanning uses lists of patches and standard
          definitions of baseline configurations, threat hunting is an
          assessment technique that utilizes insights gained from threat
          intelligence to proactively discover whether there is evidence of TTPs
          already present within the network or system. This contrasts with a
          reactive process that is only triggered when alert conditions are
          reported through an incident management system. You can also contrast
          threat hunting with penetration testing. Where a pen test attempts to
          achieve some sort of system intrusion or concrete demonstration of
          weakness, threat hunting is based only on analysis of data within the
          system. To that extent, it is less potentially disruptive than pen
          testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          A threat hunting project is likely to be led by senior security
          analysts, but some general points to observe include:>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Advisories and bulletins—threat hunting is a labor-intensive
            activity and so needs to be performed with clear goals and
            resources. Threat hunting usually proceeds according to some
            hypothesis of possible threat. Security bulletins and advisories
            from vendors and security researchers about new TTPs and/or
            vulnerabilities may be the trigger for establishing a threat hunt.
            For example, if threat intelligence reveals that Windows desktops in
            many companies are being infected with a new type of malware that is
            not being blocked by any current malware definitions, you might
            initiate the following threat-hunting plan to detect whether the
            malware is also infecting your systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intelligence fusion and threat data—threat hunting can be performed
            by manual analysis of network and log data, but this is a very
            lengthy process. An organization with a security information and
            event management (SIEM) and threat analytics platform can apply
            intelligence fusion techniques. The analytics platform is kept up to
            date with a TTP and IoC threat data feed. Analysts can develop
            queries and filters to correlate threat data against on-premises
            data from network traffic and logs. This process may also be
            partially or wholly automated using AI-assisted analysis and
            correlation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maneuver—when investigating a suspected live threat, you must
            remember the adversarial nature of hacking. A capable threat actor
            is likely to have anticipated the likelihood of threat hunting, and
            attempted to deploy countermeasures to frustrate detection. For
            example, the attacker may trigger a DDoS attack to divert the
            security team's attention, and then attempt to accelerate plans to
            achieve actions on objectives. Maneuver is a military doctrine term
            relating to obtaining positional advantage
            (ccdcoe.org/uploads/2012/01/3_3_Applegate_ThePrincipleOfManeuverInCyberOperations.pdf).
            As an example of defensive maneuver, threat hunting might use
            passive discovery techniques so that threat actors are given no hint
            that an intrusion has been discovered before the security team has a
            containment, eradication, and recovery plan.
