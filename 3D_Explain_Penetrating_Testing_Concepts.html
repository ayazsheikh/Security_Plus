        <h4>PENETRATION TESTING</h4>
        <p>
          A penetration test—often shortened to pen test—uses authorized hacking
          techniques to discover exploitable weaknesses in the target's security
          systems. Pen testing is also referred to as ethical hacking. A pen
          test might involve the following steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Verify a threat exists—use surveillance, social engineering, network
            scanners, and vulnerability assessment tools to identify a vector by
            which vulnerabilities could be exploited.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bypass security controls—look for easy ways to attack the system.
            For example, if the network is strongly protected by a firewall, is
            it possible to gain physical access to a computer in the building
            and run malware from a USB stick?
          </li>
          <li>
            Actively test security controls—probe controls for configuration
            weaknesses and errors, such as weak passwords or software
            vulnerabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exploit vulnerabilities—prove that a vulnerability is high risk by
            exploiting it to gain access to data or install backdoors.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The key difference from passive vulnerability assessment is that an
          attempt is made to actively test security controls and exploit any
          vulnerabilities discovered. Pen testing is an intrusive assessment
          technique. For example, a vulnerability scan may reveal that an SQL
          Server has not been patched to safeguard against a known exploit. A
          penetration test would attempt to use the exploit to perform code
          injection and compromise and "own" (or "pwn" in hacker idiom) the
          server. This provides active testing of security controls. Even though
          the potential for the exploit exists, in practice the permissions on
          the server might prevent an attacker from using it. This would not be
          identified by a vulnerability scan, but should be proven or not proven
          to be the case by penetration testing.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT</h4>
        <p>
          Security assessments might be performed by employees or may be
          contracted to consultants or other third parties. Rules of engagement
          specify what activity is permitted or not permitted. These rules
          should be made explicit in a contractual agreement. For example, a pen
          test should have a concrete objective and scope rather than a vague
          type of "Break into the network" aim. There may be systems and data
          that the penetration tester should not attempt to access or exploit.
          Where a pen test involves third-party services (such as a cloud
          provider), authorization to conduct the test must also be sought from
          the third party.

            The Pentest-Standard website provides invaluable commentary on the
            conduct of pen tests

        <h4>Attack Profile</h4>
        <p>
          Attacks come from different sources and motivations. You may wish to
          test both resistance to external (targeted and untargeted) and insider
          threats. You need to determine how much information about the network
          to provide to the consultant
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Black box (or unknown environment)—the consultant is given no
            privileged information about the network and its security systems.
            This type of test would require the tester to perform a
            reconnaissance phase. Black box tests are useful for simulating the
            behavior of an external threat.
          </li>
          <li>
            White box (or known environment)—the consultant is given complete
            access to information about the network. This type of test is
            sometimes conducted as a follow-up to a black box test to fully
            evaluate flaws discovered during the black box test. The tester
            skips the reconnaissance phase in this type of test. White box tests
            are useful for simulating the behavior of a privileged insider
            threat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gray box (or partially known environment)—the consultant is given
            some information; typically, this would resemble the knowledge of
            junior or non-IT staff to model particular types of insider threats.
            This type of test requires partial reconnaissance on the part of the
            tester. Gray box tests are useful for simulating the behavior of an
            unprivileged insider threat.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A test where the attacker has no knowledge of the system but where
          staff are informed that a test will take place is referred to as a
          blind (or single-blind) test. A test where staff are not made aware
          that a pen test will take place is referred to as a double-blind test.
        </p>
        <h4>Bug Bounty</h4>
        <p>
          A bug bounty is a program operated by a software vendor or website
          operator where rewards are given for reporting vulnerabilities. Where
          a pen test is performed on a contractual basis, costed by the
          consultant, a bug bounty program is a way of crowd sourcing detection
          of vulnerabilities. Some bug bounties are operated as internal
          programs, with rewards for employees only. Most are open to public
          submissions
          (tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/cyber-security/essential-bug-bounty-programs).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>EXERCISE TYPES</h4>
        <p>
          Some of the techniques used in penetration testing may also be
          employed as an exercise between two competing teams:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Red team—performs the offensive role to try to infiltrate the
            target.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blue team—performs the defensive role by operating monitoring and
            alerting controls to detect and prevent the infiltration.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There will also often be a white team, which sets the rules of
          engagement and monitors the exercise, providing arbitration and
          guidance, if necessary. If the red team is third party, the white team
          will include a representative of the consultancy company. One critical
          task of the white team is to halt the exercise should it become too
          risky. For example, an actual threat actor may attempt to piggyback a
          backdoor established by the red team.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a red versus blue team exercise, the typical process is for the red
          team to attempt the intrusion and either succeed or fail, and then to
          write a summary report. This confrontational structure does not always
          promote constructive development and improvement. In a purple team
          exercise, the red and blue teams meet for regular debriefs while the
          exercise is ongoing. The red team might reveal where they have been
          successful and collaborate with the blue team on working out a
          detection mechanism. This process might be assisted by purple team
          members acting as facilitators. The drawback of a purple team exercise
          is that without blind or double-blind conditions, there is no
          simulation of a hostile adversary and the stresses of dealing with
          that.
        </p>

        <h4>PASSIVE AND ACTIVE RECONNAISSANCE</h4>
        <p>
          Analysis of adversary TTPs has established various "kill chain" models
          of the way modern cyber-attacks are conducted. A penetration testing
          engagement will generally use the same sort of techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first reconnaissance phase for black box testing, the pen
          tester establishes a profile of the target of investigation and
          surveys the attack surface for weaknesses. Reconnaissance activities
          can be classed as passive or active. Passive reconnaissance is not
          likely to alert the target of the investigation as it means querying
          publicly available information. Active reconnaissance has more risk of
          detection. Active techniques might involve gaining physical access to
          premises or using scanning tools on the target's web services and
          other networks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)—using web search tools, social
            media, and sites that scan for vulnerabilities in Internet-connected
            devices and services (securitytrails.com/blog/osint-tools) to obtain
            information about the target. OSINT aggregation tools, such as
            theHarvester (github.com/laramies/theHarvester), collect and
            organize this data from multiple sources. OSINT requires almost no
            privileged access as it relies on finding information that the
            company makes publicly available, whether intentionally or not. This
            is a passive technique.
          </li>
          <li>
            Social engineering—this refers to obtaining information, physical
            access to premises, or even access to a user account through the art
            of persuasion. While the amount of interaction may vary, this can be
            classed as an active technique.
          </li>
          <li>
            Footprinting—using software tools, such as Nmap (nmap.org), to
            obtain information about a host or network topology. Scans may be
            launched against web hosts or against wired or wireless network
            segments, if the attacker can gain physical access to them. While
            passive footprinting is possible (by limiting it to packet
            sniffing), most scan techniques require active network connections
            with the target that can be picked up by detection software.
          </li>
          <li>
            War driving—mapping the location and type (frequency channel and
            security method) of wireless networks operated by the target. Some
            of these networks may be accessible from outside the building.
            Simply sniffing the presence of wireless networks is a passive
            activity, though there is the risk of being observed by security
            guards or cameras. An attacker might be able to position rogue
            access points, such as the Hak5 Pineapple
            (shop.hak5.org/products/wifi-pineapple), or perform other wireless
            attacks using intelligence gathered from war driving.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drones/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)—allow the tester to reconnoiter
            campus premises, and even to perform war driving from the air (war
            flying). A tool such as the Wi-Fi Pineapple can easily be
            incorporated on a drone
            (hackaday.com/2018/05/27/watch-dogs-inspired-hacking-drone-takes-flight).
            Drones also provide a vector for one enduringly popular social
            engineering technique; dropping infected USB media around premises,
            with the expectation that at least some of them will be picked up
            and used
            (blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Bursztein-Does-Dropping-USB-Drives-In-Parking-Lots-And-Other-Places-Really-Work.pdf).

        <h4>PEN TEST ATTACK LIFE CYCLE</h4>
        <p>
          In the kill chain attack life cycle, reconnaissance is followed by an
          initial exploitation phase where a software tool is used to gain some
          sort of access to the target's network. This foothold might be
          accomplished using a phishing email and payload or by obtaining
          credentials via social engineering. Having gained the foothold, the
          pen tester can then set about securing and widening access. A number
          of techniques are required:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Persistence—the tester's ability to reconnect to the compromised
            host and use it as a remote access tool (RAT) or backdoor. To do
            this, the tester must establish a command and control (C2 or C&C)
            network to use to control the compromised host, upload additional
            attack tools, and download exfiltrated data. The connection to the
            compromised host will typically require a malware executable to run
            after shut down/log off events and a connection to a network port
            and the attacker's IP address to be available.
          </li>
          <li>
            Privilege escalation—persistence is followed by further
            reconnaissance, where the pen tester attempts to map out the
            internal network and discover the services running on it and
            accounts configured to access it. Moving within the network or
            accessing data assets are likely to require higher privilege levels.
            For example, the original malware may have run with local
            administrator privileges on a client workstation or as the Apache
            user on a web server. Another exploit might allow malware to execute
            with system/root privileges, or to use network administrator
            privileges on other hosts, such as application servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lateral movement—gaining control over other hosts. This is done
            partly to discover more opportunities to widen access (harvesting
            credentials, detecting software vulnerabilities, and gathering other
            such "loot"), partly to identify where valuable data assets might be
            located, and partly to evade detection. Lateral movement usually
            involves executing the attack tools over remote process shares or
            using scripting tools, such as PowerShell.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pivoting—hosts that hold the most valuable data are not normally
            able to access external networks directly. If the pen tester
            achieves a foothold on a perimeter server, a pivot allows them to
            bypass a network boundary and compromise servers on an inside
            network. A pivot is normally accomplished using remote access and
            tunneling protocols, such as Secure Shell (SSH), virtual private
            networking (VPN), or remote desktop.
          </li>
          <li>
            Actions on Objectives—for a threat actor, this means stealing data
            from one or more systems (data exfiltration). From the perspective
            of a pen tester, it would be a matter of the scope definition
            whether this would be attempted. In most cases, it is usually
            sufficient to show that actions on objectives could be achieved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cleanup—for a threat actor, this means removing evidence of the
            attack, or at least evidence that could implicate the threat actor.
            For a pen tester, this phase means removing any backdoors or tools
            and ensuring that the system is not less secure than the
            pre-engagement state.
          </li>
